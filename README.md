# carpyt

## A module creation tool for Python.

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6-lightgrey.svg)

Making modules in Python is harder than it should be, so let's make it easier by creating the module structure automatically. **carpyt** is a module creation tool for Python, that is _heavily inspired_ by Cargo, Rust's package manager. My aim is to get **carpyt** rolled into pip as the `pip new` command.

## Features

**carpyt** has a miriad of wonderful features, none of which have actually been implemented yet, including:

* Automated creation of the module folder structure
* Automatic `setup.py` creation
* A choice of module style (bin or lib)
* Unit tests from day 0
* Easily create docs!
* Git integration (to initialise a repo and scrape your deets!)
* Easy publishing to PyPI

With these amazing features, why wouldn't you use **carpyt**!?

## Getting Started

It's easy to install **carpyt**:

```pip install carpyt```

And then you can make a new module like this:

```carpyt new --bin super_great_cmdline_tool```

## FAQs

No one's ever asked me _any_ questions about this project, but that's not going to stop me having an FAQ section!

### Why is called **carpyt**?

A great question! The name is a portmanteau of Cargo and Python, and fufils one of the major criteria of all great Python modules, it has Py in the title.

### How do you even pronouce **carpyt**?

It could be pronounced carpet, which is great because there's a snake called a carpet python, so that would work wonderfully, but my brain is incapable of allowing me to pronounce it any way apart from car-pie-t. Either way, it doesn't matter really.

### Can I contribute?

YES! Just come along and do stuff. Make suggestions, complain, chat about the weather or even submit pull requests. I'll try and have some "need help" issue open at all times, come and snag one of those if you like.

### Why don't the commands you've listed in the getting started section actually work?

They do work, I saw them running in my head movies.

### I'm not sure about this project, it seems a bit rubbish...

That's not a question. Obviously you know nothing, have you not noticed the badges in this README? When was the last time you saw a rubbish project on GitHub that had tonnes of badges? Never, that's when.
